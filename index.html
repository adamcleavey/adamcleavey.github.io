<!--
	I'm wondering what you expected to be here. A bunch of hastily pasted in and auto-generated analytics 
	code, maybe; possibly you'd see the crumbs of whatever static site generator I used to produce it.
	None of that is here.  
	
	For one, I didn't use a generator or a template, I wrote valid HTML code by hand because that was all 
	that was needed and to undergo more effort than that would have been a waste of time.  I also am not 
	monitoring this page with analytics, for what i would hope would be obvious reasons.
	
	More likely, though, you checked this site because it was habitual for you to do so: you needed to 
	see under the curtain, to establish yourself as unlike the other rubes who see the internet as it is 
	presented to them and not how it actually is.  You wanted to remind yourself you were part of a club.
	
	Working on the internet is not a substitute for a personality. It is not a ticket into a social life, 
	and it is not cool.  We're in the world we're in because people jumped on the web and made things for 
	themselves that made themselves feel good. Now we need people who will work to make things for other 
	people, people not like them.  If you don't think your enthusiasm for the craft will survive that, 
	then please, do what you can to minimize the harm you cause while you're here tooling for an affectation.
